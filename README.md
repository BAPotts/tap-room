# **USER STORIES**

* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list. 
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page. 
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints. 
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.</h3>
